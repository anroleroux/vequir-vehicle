name: cad-part
description: Add or change a 3D part, or an assembly's assembled model, in the VequIR catalogues built with the CAD tool (vequir-standard, vequir-power, vequir-unit, vequir-vehicle) from natural-language instructions, then build its CAD (B-rep, STEP, STL, views) and update the HTML site. Use whenever the user names a product, assembly and part designation (e.g. "PB6 / chassis / lid", "PB6-chassis-lid", "in PB6, assembly drive, sub-assembly left_wheel, part hub", "MV1 / chassis / beam") or an assembly designation ("PB6 / chassis: assemble the lid on the box") together with modelling instructions, or asks to add, modify, remove, rename or rebuild a product, assembly, sub-assembly or part. For model vehicles (vequir-vehicle) it applies the vehicle directions: longitudinal = x (front-back, +x front), lateral = y (sideways, +y left), z up.

# Add or change a CAD part

Each part is a CadQuery script written from a plain-language description.
This skill takes the user's instructions for one part from words to a
published 3D model: **description → part.py (B-rep code) → CAD files → HTML**.

## Which repository

The CAD tool (the `cad` command) lives in vequir-standard under
`tools/cad/` (`tools/cad/src/cad` and its tests); vequir-power, vequir-unit and vequir-vehicle
install it from their clone of vequir-standard. The catalogue is split over
four repositories, each with its own CI and its own
product page (its catalogue site on GitHub Pages):

| Repository | Holds | Page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vequir-standard` | `library/`: everything bought in — `power/` (cells, battery clips, the BMS, charger boards), `hardware/` (screws), `electronics/` (the Pico 2 W and other boards) | anroleroux.co.za/vequir-standard |
| `vequir-power` | `library/`: what VequIR makes for packs — `battery_holders/` (the single 18650 holder and its body, the six-cell pack) and `brackets/` (the end strip, clamping beam and BMS clamp) | anroleroux.co.za/vequir-power |
| `vequir-unit` | `products/`: VequIR's own units, such as the PB6 powerbank: only each one's enclosure parts and its one assembly | anroleroux.co.za/vequir-unit |
| `vequir-vehicle` | `products/`: model vehicles, one product per vehicle (`MV1`), broken down into assemblies such as `chassis` | anroleroux.co.za/vequir-vehicle |


- Pick the repository by what the item is: anything bought in (a cell, a
  screw, a board) goes in vequir-standard, in the category that fits
  (power, hardware, electronics; add one if none does); a holder, bracket,
  strip or pack in vequir-power; a product's enclosure parts and its
  assembly in vequir-unit; a model vehicle and its assemblies and parts
  (chassis, beams, axles, wheels, body) in vequir-vehicle. If it is unclear, ask.
- A repository uses the others' libraries through `libraries.txt` at its
  root: one library directory per line, relative to the file, then the site
  that publishes it
  (`../vequir-standard/library https://anroleroux.co.za/vequir-standard/`);
  an assembly's page links what it places to that site. vequir-power lists vequir-standard;
  vequir-unit lists both; vequir-vehicle lists vequir-standard (add
  vequir-power when a vehicle carries a pack). `load_library` searches its own `library/` first,
  then those. Dependencies only point down: unit, vehicle → power → standard. Never
  make vequir-standard use vequir-power.
- The other direction is display only: a library repository's `used-by.txt`
  lists the sites of the repositories that use it, and its item pages read
  their `uses.json` for "Used in". When a repository starts using another's
  library, add its site to that library's `used-by.txt`.
- So clone the repositories side by side (`vequir-standard/`,
  `vequir-power/`, `vequir-unit/`, `vequir-vehicle/`) and run every command from the root of
  the repository being changed.
- A change to a part that others use (the cell's diameter) is made in its
  own repository and checked in the users too: rebuild them before
  committing. Push all the touched repositories to the same branch name; CI
  clones a sibling on that branch when it exists, else its default branch.

## Vehicle directions

vequir-vehicle designs model vehicles, and its instructions use vehicle
terms. Read them as these axes, in every part and assembly script there:

| Term | Axis | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **longitudinal** | **x** | front–back, along the vehicle's length; **+x is the front**, −x the rear |
| **lateral** | **y** | sideways, across the vehicle's width; **+y is the left** (facing forward), −y the right |
| **vertical** | **z** | **up**; the vehicle stands on z = 0 |

That is a right-handed frame: x forward, y left, z up (as in ISO 8855).

- Name dimensions by direction: `length` is along x, `width` along y,
  `height` along z. "A longitudinal beam" (a side rail) runs along x;
  "a lateral cross-member" runs along y; "the wheelbase" is the x distance
  between the axles; "the track" is the y distance between a pair of
  wheels' centres.
- Centre a vehicle's parts on the centreline (y = 0) unless the
  instructions put them to one side. "Left" and "right" are +y and −y,
  "front" and "rear" +x and −x, "above" and "below" +z and −z. A part with
  a left and a right copy is modelled once and placed twice in the assembly
  (offset, or mirrored if it is handed).
- Model each part in its vehicle orientation (a longitudinal part with its
  length along x), so an assembly places it with a translation, not a
  rotation, wherever it can.
- State the axes in the docstring's assumptions ("longitudinal along x,
  centred on x = 0 and y = 0, standing on z = 0"), so the page shows them.
- Check the direction in `summary.json`: a longitudinal part's bounding
  box is longest in x, a lateral one's in y.

## The breakdown


```
products/<PRODUCT>/product.md                       "# Title" + blurb
products/<PRODUCT>/assembly.py                      optional: the whole product, assembled
products/<PRODUCT>/<part>/...                       a part of the product itself (e.g. PB6/lid)
products/<PRODUCT>/<assembly>/assembly.md           "# Title" + blurb
products/<PRODUCT>/<assembly>/<sub>/.../assembly.md  sub-assemblies, any depth
products/<PRODUCT>/<assembly>/.../<part>/description.md   the instructions (source of truth)
products/<PRODUCT>/<assembly>/.../<part>/part.py          the CadQuery script
products/<PRODUCT>/<assembly>/assembly.py                 optional: the assembled model
```

- A product holds assemblies **and** parts of its own (`PB6/lid`), and may have
  an `assembly.py` for the whole product. An assembly holds **either**
  sub-assemblies **or** parts (it is a leaf), never both.
- A part's **designation** is its path: `PB6/chassis/lid`. An assembly's is
  its path too: `PB6/chassis`.
- Product directories keep the user's code as given (`PB6`). Assembly and part
  slugs are lowercase with underscores (`motor_mounts`, `left_wheel`). Titles
  for display go in the markdown files.
- `cad site` refuses a breakdown that breaks these rules, and names the
  offending directory.

## The parts library

```
library/<category>/category.md                    "# Title" + blurb
library/<category>/<part>/...                     a reusable part
library/<category>/<assembly>/assembly.md         a reusable assembly (holder body + cell + clips)
library/<category>/<assembly>/assembly.py         optional: its assembled model
library/<category>/<assembly>/<part>/...          its parts
```

- Put a part or assembly in the library when the user says it is for reuse,
  names a category ("a battery holder in the battery holders category"), or
  says "library/…". A product-specific part stays in `products/`.
- A category follows a product's rules: it holds parts and assemblies. Its
  slug is lowercase with underscores and plural (`battery_holders`,
  `motor_mounts`). Write its `category.md` when it is new.
- Its designation for `cad build` is `library/<category>/<item>/...`.
  Scripts place it with `load_library("<category>/<item>")`, which takes the
  same path without `library/` and works from any depth. Use it in products
  rather than copying a library part.
- Inside a library assembly, parts use `load_part` on each other as usual,
  and `load_library` for another library's items (the holder body sizes
  itself from `load_library("power/cell_18650")`).
- Worked example: vequir-power's `library/battery_holders/single_18650_holder/`.

## Steps

0. **Set up, once per session**: `pip install -e "../vequir-standard/tools/cad[dev]"`
   from the catalogue repository (`./tools/cad[dev]` in vequir-standard) (CadQuery is heavy, so give it a few minutes), and make
   sure the repositories its `libraries.txt` names are cloned beside it.
   Check it with `cad --help`.

1. **Resolve the designation.** Split what the user gave into product, the
   assembly chain and the part, and normalise the slugs. List what exists with
   `find products library -name part.py` (and `ls` the product). Decide which levels
   are new and which already exist.
   - If the user's designation conflicts with the rules (for example, a part
     placed in an assembly that already has sub-assemblies), say so and propose
     where it should go. Don't restructure silently.
   - If the user gives no assembly, ask for one. Don't invent the hierarchy.

2. **Create the missing levels.**
   - For a new product, write `product.md`: `# <Title>`, then one or two
     sentences.
   - For each new assembly or sub-assembly, write `assembly.md` the same way.
   - Use the user's wording where they gave it. Otherwise keep it short and
     factual.

3. **Write or update `description.md`.** This file is the natural-language
   source of truth that the page shows.
   - **New part:** record the user's instructions as clear prose. Keep every
     dimension, count, position and standard they gave. Fix only grammar.
   - **Changed part:** edit the sentences the change touches and keep the rest
     verbatim. Don't rewrite the whole description.

4. **Write or update `part.py`.** Follow the part-script contract, which is the
   same one `cad.nl2cad.SYSTEM_PROMPT` gives the model:
   - Import only `cadquery as cq` (and `math` if needed).
   - Open with a docstring:
     - **First line:** the part's title (it becomes the heading on the page).
     - **Then:** every assumption made where the description is silent.
   - Name every dimension as a constant in mm with a short comment. No magic
     numbers further down.
   - Model z up, with the part standing on z = 0. In vequir-vehicle, x is
     longitudinal (front +x) and y lateral (left +y): see *Vehicle directions*.
   - Assign `result`: a valid solid.
   - Assign `regions`: a dict naming mounting faces, holes, bores and similar.
     Use `{}` if there are none.
   - End with the `show_object` guard.
   - Prefer sketches and workplanes. Add fillets last, on explicit selections.
   - ISO clearance holes: M3 → 3.4, M4 → 4.5, M5 → 5.5 mm.
   - When changing a part, edit the existing script: change the constants and
     features the instruction touches, and keep the assumptions list current.

   - **A part that must fit another one** (a lid on a box, a shaft in a
     bore) reads the other part's variables instead of copying the numbers:
     `box = load_part("../base")`, then `box.l`, `box.wall`. The path is
     relative to the script's directory, and `load_part` is available in every
     script. That way the fit survives a change to the other part. Put the
     fit itself (clearance, overlap) in named constants.

   Worked examples:
   - vequir-standard's `library/hardware/m1_2x6_countersunk/part.py`: a
     standalone part;
   - vequir-unit's `products/PB6/lid/part.py`: a part sized from another with `load_part`;
   - vequir-vehicle's `products/MV1/chassis/beam/part.py`: a longitudinal
     vehicle part, its length along x.

4b. **Assembled model (`assembly.py`)**, when the user asks for parts to be
   put together ("assemble the lid on top of the box"). Write
   `products/<PRODUCT>/<assembly>/assembly.py`:
   - **Docstring:** first line is the model's title.
   - **Load the parts:** `base = load_part("base")`, `lid = load_part("lid")`.
     The paths are relative to the assembly directory. A sub-assembly loads
     the same way (`chassis = load_part("chassis")` gives its `cq.Assembly`
     as `.result`), so a product-level `assembly.py` can place whole
     assemblies.
   - **Several copies of one part** (four cells): add `part.result` once per
     copy, each with its own `name` (`battery_1` …) and `loc`. To lay a part
     down, rotate it: `cq.Location(cq.Vector(x, y, z), cq.Vector(0, 1, 0), 90)`
     turns its +z axis to +x.
   - **Place them:** `result = cq.Assembly(name=...)`, with `.add(part.result,
     name=..., loc=cq.Location((x, y, z)))` for each part. Derive every offset
     from the parts' own variables (`base.h - lid.lip_depth`), never from
     copied numbers. Give each part a `color`: the PNGs and the 3D viewer
     use it (a component without one gets a palette colour). Set `regions = {}`.
   - **Build:** `cad build <PRODUCT>/<assembly>`. The summary lists:
     - **components**: what the assembly holds directly (a part, or a whole
       sub-assembly as one), by name, with volume, bounding box and the
       meshes (STL and colour) of every shape inside;
     - **interference**: pairs of components that share volume. It must be
       empty unless an overlap is intended. A screw forming its thread in a
       tap hole (a thin coaxial ring of overlap) is marked `"thread": true`;
       the site leaves those out and counts them on one line;
     - **contacts**: pairs touching over an area, in mm². A seated lid shows
       its rim area.
   - **Check:** fix any interference or missing contact, then look at both
     PNGs, where each component has its own colour.

5. **Build and check it.** Run `cad build <designation>`. For a part it
   writes `results/<designation>/cad/` (for an assembly model,
   `results/<designation>/_assembly/cad/`):
   - `part.brep`, `part.step`, `part.stl`;
   - `part.png` and `part_rear_below.png`;
   - `summary.json`.

   If the build fails, the error names the script line. Fix the script and
   build again. Then verify against the description; don't skip this:
   - Compare `summary.json` with the description: bounding box, volume, the
     number of cylinder faces (holes and bores), and the regions.
   - **Look at both PNGs** with the Read tool. Check every feature is there, in
     the right count, place and orientation, and that nothing extra appeared.
   - Iterate until it matches. If a dimension cannot work as described (for
     example, holes that overlap an edge), choose the nearest sound value,
     record it under the docstring's assumptions, and tell the user.

6. **Update the site.** Run `cad site --out results --site site`.
   It rebuilds every part, then writes one page per level:
   - `site/index.html`: the overview, a card per product (in a library
     repository, the library's categories), titled from `site.md`;
   - `site/products/<PRODUCT>/index.html` and `.../<assembly>/index.html`:
     each level's contents as cards, then its assembled model;
   - `site/products/<PRODUCT>/.../<part>/index.html`: one page per part.

   It exits non-zero if any part fails to build. To look at the page, serve
   `site/` with `python -m http.server` and screenshot it with headless
   Chromium (Playwright with `executablePath: /opt/pw-browsers/chromium-*/chrome-linux/chrome`).
   Three.js loads from jsDelivr. If the sandbox blocks the CDN, the page falls
   back to the PNG views.

7. **Test**: `python -m pytest -q tests` in the catalogue repository (its
   checks of the real parts), and in vequir-standard's `tools/cad/`
   (`cd tools/cad && python -m pytest -q`) when the tool's code changed. Update
   a test whose numbers the change moves on purpose.

8. **Commit and push.**
   - Commit only `products/` or `library/` changes (and tests or code, if
     any). Never commit `results/` or `site/`; they are build output and are
     git-ignored.
   - Message: `Add PB6/chassis/lid: <one line>` or `Update …: <what changed>`.
   - Push to the working branch. That repository's CI rebuilds its parts and
     redeploys its page on push.
   - If the shop (`vequir`) sells the item, its still and meshes come over
     with `make/cad.py`; see the shop's README.

9. **Report back**, in a few lines:
   - the designation;
   - what was built: size and key features;
   - any assumptions you had to make;
   - the page link: `https://anroleroux.co.za/<repository>/products/<designation>/index.html`
     (e.g. `https://anroleroux.co.za/vequir-unit/products/PB6/base/index.html`).
     For a library item it is `.../<repository>/library/<category>/<item>/index.html`.

## Other changes

- **Rename or move a part or assembly**: use `git mv` on the directory, then
  run steps 6–9. The designation changes with the path, so tell the user the
  new one.
- **Remove**: `git rm -r` the directory, and search for `load_part` and
  `load_library` calls that name it, in every vequir repository
  (`grep -rn "load_part\|load_library" ../vequir-*/products ../vequir-*/library`). If an assembly is left empty,
  remove it too. Then run steps 6–9.
- **Change only a title or blurb**: edit `product.md` or `assembly.md`, or
  the first docstring line for a part, then run steps 6–9.
- **Several parts in one request**: do steps 1–5 for each part, then steps
  6–9 once.
